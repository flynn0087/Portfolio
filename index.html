            My name is Benjamin (Ben) Flynn. I was born on December 14, 1983 in Minneapolis, MN. I still currently live in Minneapolis, MN.
            However, I have also lived in Chicago, IL; Steamboat Springs, CO; and Telluride, CO. I lived in Chicago for two years after 
            graduating from the University of Minnesota. I lived in Colorado for a total of four winters, with one summer as well. Chicago
            was a lot of fun as it is a large city and I got to work downtown. It also had really good cheap food. I really enjoyed living 
            in Colorado as I am an avid downhill skier and snowboarder. During the summer I also enjoyed hiking. Mountains are the best! I 
            still enjoy traveling to the mountains to ski when I can.
            </p>

            <p>
            I graduated from the University of Minnesota with degrees in Economics and History. I have worked mainly in business office 
            postions. Though I have worked a variety of roles. Most had something to do with processing transactions in a CRM type software.
            I have also done quality control, editing and some publishing to a web page. I am learning to code and develop web pages to 
            hopefully expand my career opporunities. I also really enjoy using computers and play video games in my spare time. It would be
            interesting to get a chance to work on game creation; however, I have an open mind about positions as I am new to coding.
